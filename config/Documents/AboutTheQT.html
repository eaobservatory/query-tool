<p><big> The OMP Query Tool (QT) is provided to allow observers at the telescope
  (and possibly support scientists in Hilo) to query the MSB and Project
databases   to determine the most appropriate observations to take given
the current  weather and scheduling conditions.  </big></p>
       
<p><big> The QT can be thought of as a short-term scheduler. It can be used
  to determine the best observation to take now and to allow the observer
to  plan a single nights observing (assuming estimates of weather conditions
 and knowledge of current instrument availability) but it will not be able
 to estimate the mid- to long term schedule for the telescope.   </big></p>
       
<p><big> In addition to providing a means to query the databases the tool
  will also be used to provide a means to store calibrations that can not
yet  be observed.</big></p>
<p><big>Note that only ONE query tool can be "live"&nbsp; for any telescope
at any time. &nbsp;If you attempt to execute a Query Tool while one is already
running, it will be brought up in scenario mode. &nbsp;This will let you
do most things except sending items for execution. &nbsp;Locking is done
via a lockfile, the location of which will be displayed when the tool starts
and a lock is present.<br>
 <br>
    The Information contained in this help file is designed to expalin each 
 of the features of the QT.<br>

<h2><a name="QueryScreen"></a><u>The Query Screen</u></h2>
       
<p><big>When the QT is first started the user is presented with several panels.
  &nbsp;This section will descibe each of those panels and guide the user
in  their use. &nbsp;The actual layout of the screen will depend on whether
the  user is running hte QT for the JCMT or UKIRT (or any other telescope)
since  the interface is built dynamically. &nbsp;However, some panels are
common  to both. &nbsp;These are the Data Panel, Search Paramters Panel,
Atmosphere  Panel, Instrument Panel and Results Panel. &nbsp;This screen
is designed to allow users to query for suitable projects (either a specific
project or ones meeting the query contraints). &nbsp;The user should be aware
that the QT is dumb in that it peforms minimal error checking and relys on
other systems to validate most of the query (the exception being the date
search parameters). &nbsp; Each of the main components of the QT Search Window
will now be discussed in more detail.</big></p>

<p><big>The Data Panel shows current information which could affect observations, 
 as well as containing some of the command buttons. &nbsp;The two time panels 
 at the bottom of the panel show UTC and local time respectively, and a satellite 
 image of the local region is also shown to allow users to assess upcoming 
 weather conditions. &nbsp;The "Current Info" shows current conditions if 
they are being monitored. &nbsp;In addition, there are three command buttons. 
&nbsp;Each item is described in more detail below.<br>
   </big></p>
     
<h4><big>Search Button</big></h4>
     
<p><big>Once a user has selected their search criteria on the <a
 href="#SearchParametersPanel">Search Parameters Panel</a>, &nbsp;pressing 
 this will execute the search and return the set of results matching the criteria.
 &nbsp;These results will appear as a selectable list in the <a
 href="#ResultsPanel">Results Panel</a>.</big></p>
        
<h4><big>Fetch MSB Button</big></h4>
     
<p><big>Once a set of results is obtained and one selected from the list in
the Results Panel, this button will show more detail of the selected MSB. 
 &nbsp;This will appear as a tabbed pane, so the user can easily go back to
 the results and select a new MSB without performing the query again.<br>
   </big></p>
     
<h4><big>Exit Button</big></h4>
     
<p><big>Does what it says on the can..<br>
   </big></p>
     
<h4><big>Current Info</big></h4>
     
<p><big>Displays current atmospheric and telescope information providing the
appropriate monitoring tools are executing. &nbsp;The current set of displayed
information is:<br>
   </big></p>
     
<ol>
     <li>225 GHz Tau - The optical depth of the atmosphere at 225 GHz measured
 either by the <a href="http://puuoo.caltech.edu/index.html">Caltech Submillimeter
 Observatory</a>  at Mauna Kea or by the JCMT's Water Vapour Meter.</li>
     <li>Seeing - currently not measured</li>
     <li>Airmass - The normalised thickness of the atmosphere ranging from
 1 at the zenith to infinity at the horizon. &nbsp;Related to the elevation 
 of the telecope by the fomula <i>airmass = cosec (90-elevation)</i></li>
     
</ol>
     
<p><big>If these parameters are not measured then the values will appear as
"-----".<br>
   </big></p>
     
<p><big>The "Set Current" button will set put the current values into the 
 search criteria is applicable (see Atmospher Panel). &nbsp;In addition, it
 will set the current brightness of the Moon in the Moon Panel (again, if
applicable), &nbsp;and reset the Observation Date and Time on the <a

 if they were prevously changed.<br>
   </big></p>
     
<h4><big>Satellite Image</big></h4>

 the Hawaii Region from the <a href="http://hokukea.soest.hawaii.edu/">Mauna 
 Kea Weather Center</a> (original data from NWS). &nbsp;This image shows the
 brightness temperature at 10.2 to 11.2 microns; coldest cloud tops showing

<p><big>The Program List shows all of the title of the observations in the
 selected science program. &nbsp;There may be only a single or many observations.
 &nbsp;In the case where there are more observations than will fit on the
screen, the panel will add a scrollbar to allow the user to view all of the
observations.<br>
  </big></p>
   
<p><big>Observations in the Program List will occur in one of two colours:<br>
  </big></p>
   
<ul>
    <li><big><font color="#3366ff">Blue</font> indicating that an observation
 is optional</big></li>
    <li><big>Black indicating that the observation is mandatory</big></li>
   
</ul>
  <big>The difference between the two is fairly simple; optional observations
 can be deleted (by dragging them to the Trash Can) or deferred (by dragging
 them to the <a href="#DeferredList">Deferred List</a>). &nbsp;Typically
this  will only be done for calibration observations. &nbsp;Mandatory observations
 are typically observations on a science target, and can not be deleted or
 deferred. &nbsp;Any observation which is deleted or deferred is only done
 so 'notionally'; that is to say is the MSB is retrieved again, the observations
 will reappear. &nbsp;So if the user accidentally deletes an observation
is  can be retrieved by fetching the MSB again from the Query Screen.<br>
  <br>
  A number of other functions are available from this panel. &nbsp;<i><br>
  </i></big>  
<ul>
    <li><big><i>Double<b> </b>clicking</i> on any observation will send that
 observation for execution. &nbsp;</big></li>
    <li><big><i>Right clicking </i>on a selected observation will allow the
 user to edit some of the observational parameters (currently this is limited
 to the exposure time). &nbsp;</big></li>
   
</ul>
  <big>Like deferred and deleted observations, the edits are only valid to
 the current session. &nbsp;Fetching the MSB again from the Query Screen
will  reset the values to their originals. &nbsp;Both optional and mandatory
observations  can be edited or sent for execution.<br>

<p><big>The Deferred List shows the list of deferred observations. &nbsp;When
 the QT starts up, the user is asked whether they want to use the currrent
 set of deferred observations if any exist. &nbsp;Selecting "No" &nbsp;to
this will delete all of the existing deferred observations from the system,
&nbsp;otherwise the existing observations will appear in this list. &nbsp;Similary,
on Exit, the user is asked whether they want to save any of the deferred
observations which exist. Selecting "No" will delete any observations deferred
during this and/or previous sessions, while "Yes" will preserve them for
use in the next session.<br>
  </big></p>
   
<p><big>Observations will appear in one of two colours:<br>
  </big></p>
   
<ul>
    <li><big>Blue indicating that the observation has been deferred but not
 observed</big></li>
    <li><big>Red indicating that the observation has been observed</big></li>
   
</ul>
  <big>In addition, once a deferred observation has been executed, it will
 be marked as done and time-stamped with the time at which the observation
 was executed (in local time). &nbsp;This allows the user to redo an observation
 at a later time for another project or use the same observation again without
 the need to repeat it for each MSB.<br>
  <br>
  The Deferred List can be populated by either dragging optional observations
 from the <a href="#ProgramList">Program List</a> to the Deferred List, or
 selecting a standard calibration obervation from the <a
 href="#CalibrationsMenu">Calibrations Menu</a>. &nbsp;If two identical observations 
are entered (for istance the MSB has two identical calibrations - one before 
and one after a science observation), it will appear only once on the deferred 
list.<br>
  <br>
  Deferred Observation can only be executed by using the "Send for Execution"
 button and are not editable is the way observations in the Program List
are  editable. &nbsp;However, if the Observation is first edited in the Program
 List and then copied to the deferred list, the edited values will be maintained.
 &nbsp;Items can be deleted from this list by dragging the to the Trash Can.<br>
