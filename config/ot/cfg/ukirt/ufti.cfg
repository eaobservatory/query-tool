# Name:
#    ufti.cfg
#
# Purpose:
#    UFTI configuration data file for ORAC-OT.
# 
# Description:
#    This file is organised into a series of information "blocks".  One
#    "block" provides information on a single item, though this information
#    may be complex.  A block may not have comments within it; it is in
#    fact delimited by the comment character.  For practical purposes this
#    means that you should comment each information block, as this will
#    also delimit them.  Section "Blocks" describes the options for an
#    information block.
#
# Blocks:
#    Blocks are one of the following:
#    -  keyword with a single value, e.g. DEFAULT_DISPERSER = "150lpmm";
#    -  keyword with a vector of values, e.g.
#    INSTRUMENT_APER = {0.998, -0.62, 0.0, 1.0}; or
#    -  keyword with a 2D array of values, e.g. DISPERSERS (see below).
#    Note that each value may be a string or a number, however, it must be
#    capable of being interpreted correctly by the OT.
#    -  A vector of values is initiated by "{" and ended by "}", the values
#    being delimited by commas.
#    -  A 2D table is written as a series of vectors, i.e. each "row" of
#    the table should be written as a vector, and the rows placed one after
#    another inside a surround brace of curly brackets.  It is not necessary
#    to place each row on a separate line, but it is recommended.
#
# Notes:
#    -  Blank lines are allowed anywhere and ignored.
#    -  Comment lines (starting with "#") are ignored except that they
#    delimit blocks (as outlined above).
#    -  Keywords are case-insensitive, however, everything else is case
#    sensitive.

#
# History:
#    1998 September 14 (AB):
#       Original version.  See the CVS log for numerous other changes
#       omitted here.
#    2000 May 6 (GSW):
#       Use measured instrument apertures.
#    2000 July 6 (MJC):
#       Use structured prologue.  Enabled POLARISERS.
#    2000 July 12 (MJC):
#       Replaced 2.10 and 2.424 narrow-band filters with 2.27 and
#       2.248S(1).
#    2000 August 3 (GSW):
#       Fixed some default exposure times.
#    2000 August 19 (MJC):
#       Made POLARISERS and READAREAS lookup tables including their X
#       and Y instrument apertures.
#    2001 January 19 (MJC):
#       Renamed 2.166 and 2.188 filters to BrG and BrGz respectively.
#       Change the latter's central wavelength to 2.173.
#    2001 January 23 (MJC):
#       Revise X-Y instrument apertures after dichroic change.
#    2001 March 4 (MJC):
#       Revise 512-pixel sub-array X instrument aperture after TRISPEC
#       run.
#    2001 April 17 (MJC):
#       Latest 1024 and 512-pixel apertures to centre upon the correct
#       pixel for WCS.
#    2001 April 25 (MJC):
#       Revised polarimetry instrument aperture from CJD's data.
#    2001 June 5 (MJC):
#       Make the FP an honorary polariser, so that the instrument-
#       configuration GUI needs minimal change, yet permit instrument
#       apertures to be accessed for the FP.
