    <h1> <font color = red>Known Bugs </h1> </font>

The ORAC-OT currently has a number of known bugs and wish list items.

The 31-Jul-2000 revision of the list is  noted here for information.

Most can be worked around, or do not affect use of the Libraries.



<p>

- Adding a guide star from target adds in J2000 regardless of equinox of
  target...  <em> It is best to use the position editor to do a coordinate transformation before choosing a guide star </em>

<p>


- It allows you to put an Iterator into a sequence for an instrument 
  which does not match the one higher in the observation. 
<p>

- Instrument aperture calculation for rotated slits in CGS4, is not yet accurate enough to avoid the need to search for the beam at the telescope.

<p>
- The "undo" button does not always work properly on
   some items (e.g. coadds in inst. component, title on observation) -It
   sometimes seems to undo back to a blank instead of the previous value.
<p>

A "Check Button" for user errors such as matching dark and object exposure times is still to be implemented.

<p>

- location of cgs4 slit wrt the base position in drawing on the position editor   needs
  to reflect the standard peakup row. 
<p>

- CGS4 slit angles change to a peculiar value when a user enters an illegal value. 
  Allowed values are fine.

<p>

Feedback of the CGS4 wavelength coverage is wrong, at least sometimes
  (it appears to get it more-or-less correct on some occasions, but wildly
  wrong on others - try entering 1.15 as the central wavelength).
  It also gets the resolution wrong as well on occasion.
  "OT appears to give a wavelength range of almost 1.5 microns by the
  time you get to 4.6 microns. the coverage appears to increase 
  monotonically from a correct value when set at around 2.0 microns."
<p>

- If attempt to save to place where can't (other users dir?) then get
"file not found" - misleading error mess.  <em> you can however
explicitely use "save as" to choose a directory - the default for save
is to try and save back to the directory the file came from. </em>

<p>
- desirable: an undo botton on the science program window.

<p>
- Occasional "Disappearing" menus (click & they come/go), click again and they're ok.

<p>
Random swapping around of guide and base coordinates can lead to the non implemented "user|" tag appearing.

<p>


- exception handling on sending things to database...I think better error
  descriptions in the ErrorBoxes could be provided.
<p>

- Cut & paste problems - sometimes it just stops working

<p>
  

- Closing & save checking on open windows - there have been some reports of problems.
 "if you create a program and then try to close it without saving,
  you can't - or at least I can't. i.e. file...close...don't save doesn't
  close - everything just stays put. Possibly related instances 
   where "close" lets you
  out without prompting for a save.....  All are (very) intermittent.
 
<p>

- Rename or change the "pencil" icon in the component editors (*not* the 
  "needs save" pencil the other one). Change "pencil" icon on save button to a floppy disk...
  
<p>
- If you hit "new note"
  while an  observation is  highlighted, the note  does not go  into the
  programme below the observation -  it becomes part of the observation.
  this is  a pain if  you're trying to  use notes to annotate  an entire
  nights programme. <em> if you create the note you can later drag it to
the desired place </em>

-  OT windows for "look and feel" : Tabs on
  instrument components not right - order is partly a function of
  whether item is a drop down menu, or box you type a value in. Other
  components (coords, iterators etc) all have reasonable behaviour.

<p>

- various font problems on windows

<p>



- in the program or library windows - the text widget at the bottom
  that's supposed to remind you what the button you're pointing at
  actually does - the text pops up for a split second as the pointer
  moves onto the button, then dissapears again. On closer investigation,
  the text is present, only when the pointer is over the putton boundary
  (ie the 1-pixel(?) wide shaded border that the buttons have)...


<p>

If you choose exit on the help browser, it exits the OT as well and
does not prompt for a save of unsaved program changes - beware !

<p>

Specific to running on JDK1.2
==============================
<p>
- dialogue box locations & sizes

- default sizing of GUIS not working properly (OT and OM).

- more preferences to save

- fonts!!

- JDK1.2 slowness & disastrous at JAC on Solaris.

- Resizing SP tree on Solaris, when scroll backwards. Requires refresh.
