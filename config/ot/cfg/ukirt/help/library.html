The libraries are provided to make preparing your observing program
fast and easy.  To open a library go to the "File ..." menu on the OT,
and select the one you need. There are currently 4 libraries available
:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The UKIRT-Templates Library </li>
<li> UFTI-Standards Library </li>
<li> IRCAM3-Standards Library </li>
<li> CGS4-Bright-GStars </li>
</ul>
<p>

The three standard star libraries contain pre-defined observations of
standard stars which you can copy into your science program.  They are
"ready to use", except that in the CGS4 case you will have to select
your wavelength and grating.

<p>

The UKIRT-Templates Library contains "template" observations for
standard observing techniques with each UKIRT instrument, IRPOL and
the FP.  Guides to the template sequences are in preparation.  In the
meantime your support scientist will advise you which are the best
ones to use for your observing program.
