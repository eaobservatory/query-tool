    <h1> <font color = red> Introduction to using the ORAC OT </h1> </font>

<p>
The ORAC observing tool (ORAC-OT) is derived from the Gemini Observing
tool, with changes to reflect the UKIRT observing paradigm, telescope
and instruments. The "look and feel" and essential functionality of
the Gemini-OT have been maintained, and core features such as the
appearance and behavior of the desk top and tools icons are
identical to the Gemini-OT.
<p>
The ORAC-OT provides a visual editor designed to allow you to fully
prepare your observations in advance of your run by specifying : the
instrument set up, target and guide star positions, sequences of
telescope moves and instrument/IRPOL/FP changes, data reduction
recipes, standard star observations. It also has features which are
intended for use for flexible/queued observing such as specifying
weather conditions and "chaining" observations together, which are not
currently in use at UKIRT, and should simply be ignored.  
<p>
A <em>Science Program</em> defines a number of <em> Observations </em>
of astronomical targets and calibrations, which need to be obtained to
achieve a scientific goal.  Thus at UKIRT a Science Program contains
the definitions of all the observations that will make up a PATT run
or a night of service observing.  No limit is enforced on the number
of Science Programs you create per PATT run, but since the rest of
ORAC is designed to fetch only one at a time from the database it
recommended that you create one Science Program containing everything
you need for your observing run.  A Science Program can contain observations
to be taken with any UKIRT instrument, it is not instrument specific.

<p>
An <em> Observation </em> defines the data and how to acquire it for
an astronomical target or a calibration.  An Observation may thus
consist of "array_tests", in which a series of darks are obtained, or
JHK photometry of a point source, spectroscopy of an extended target,
or a flat and an arc. The <em> Observation </em> component in the OT
contains items which together specify the target coordinates, the
guide star location, the instrument configuration, the types of data
to be obtained (Darks, flats, arcs, etc), the order in which data is
to be obtained, the ORAC-DR recipe and the sequence of telescope moves
and exposures to be used.

<p>
The OT is used to create your Science program by copying into it a template
for the type of observation you need and editing it, for each observation in
the programme.  Depending on your program you may have one observation for
each target or several.

<p>
The best way to become familiar with the OT capabilities is to create
a Science Program containing your observations based on the 
The UKIRT Template Library.
<p>
The documents below provide information about using the OT with various levels of detail.  The first three should cover all that you need for normal UKIRT observing, while the remaining documents provide help in how to construct observations from scratch without using the templates.
