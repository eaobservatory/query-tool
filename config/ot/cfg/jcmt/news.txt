Swing version of Orac OT.

Some features off the new Swing OT differ from
those in the old FreeBongo OT:

  Copying components by dragging and dropping:
    Press CONTROL key during dragging. (Press mouse first. Then press CONTROL key.)

  Using the DELETE and BACKSPACE keys to delete selected nodes:
    This works only if the most recent mouse click occured on the Science Programme tree panel.
    (e. g. by selecting a node of this tree).

  Multiple tree node selection:
    Arbitrary multiple tree node selections are now allowed. Selecting nodes works like in standard file managers:
    Selecting contiguous nodes: select first node, hold SHIFT key, select second node.
      
    Selecting dis-contiguous nodes: select node, hold CONTROL key, (un)select next node, ... 

    The selected nodes can be deleted (with DELETE or BACKSPACE) or dragged and dropped.

    WARNING: Remember that the multiple node selection in the FreeBongo OT was much simpler.
    Only certain contiguous nodes could be selected at the same time.
    Although this Swing OT allows arbitrary multiple selections there can be problems if arbitrary
    dis-contiguous nodes  from all over the tree are selected. Things can become to complex so that the OT
    fails to move/copy/delete all nodes. So stick to simple uses of multiple selection similar to those that
    were allowed in the FreeBongo OT. 

  Changing background pattern:
    Not supported anymore.

  Frames:
    The Swing OT can be run with internal frames inside
    one main frame (like the old FreeBongo OT). This is the default
    behaviour.
    By using the flag -nointernalframes the OT displays every Science Program
    tree in a separate frame without one OT main frame.

    ONLY THE INTERNAL FRAMES MODE (DEFAULT) PROVIDES THE FULL FUNCTIONALITY
    OF THE OLD FREEBONGO VERSION!
