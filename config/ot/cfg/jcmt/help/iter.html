    <h1> <font color = red> Sequences and Iterators in the OT </h1> </font>

Iterators and a feature of the OT that provide a powerful tool for creating
sequences in which observations of various types are taken while changing
instrument configurations, telescope positions, etc.

<p>

They have a structure like nested do loops.  It is important therefore to
make sure that "Observe" is in the right place in the hierarchy.
