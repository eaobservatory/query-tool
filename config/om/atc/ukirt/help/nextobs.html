<H1>How to Start the Next Observation</H1>

<p>

The sequence for your current Observation will stop either 
when all the commands in
it have been executed, or when you use <font color="red"> Stop ASAP </font> 
or <font color="red">Stop at Break </font> buttons on the
sequencer console to stop it.  

<p>

To start the next observation, go back to the main ORAC-OM screen.  All the
observations in your Science Program are listed and available on the
right hand side :

Move the cursor until it is over the next Observation that you wish to carry
out.  Use the send for execution button to send it to the sequencer console
ready for execution .

<p>

The new Observation will be translated and will appear on the 
sequencer console, replacing the previous sequence.

<p>
Use the <font color="lime"> Run </font> button to start executing the
sequence for your next  Observation.

<p>

<p>

If the next Observation you want to carry out is part of a different Science
Program from the one you have just completed, go back to the main ORAC-OM 
screen and move the cursor in the Program List area onto the Science Program
that contains the Observation you want.  Use the <font color="lime"> 
Fetch </font> button to fetch the program and obtain a listing of the Observations in it on the right hand side of the ORAC-OM window.  Then follow the 
above procedure.
