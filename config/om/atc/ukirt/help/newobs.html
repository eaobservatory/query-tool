<H1>How to Make and Use a New Observation</H1>

<p>

Sometimes, even if you have pre-prepared carefully for observing, it becomes
apparent during the night that you need to carry out some different 
observations, which you have not planned for.  If you need to add new 
observations to the program you submitted to the UKIRT database you can
do so at any time as follows :

<p>

There is a workstation in the observers area for you to run 
the ORAC-OT on.  Startup the ORAC-OT on this machine, by logging-in and 
then typing ORAC-OT.

<p>

On the Menu Bar at the top of the Observing Tool select "Observing Database"
and then "Fetch Program".  This will give you a login in screen to allow you
to connect to the database at UKIRT :

<spacer type=vertical size=50> 
<br clear=left>
Enter your user-id and password, and when you have done so the OT will display
a list of the Science Programs for your user-id.  If this the first observing
run for which you have used the OT to prepare observations there will only
be one Science Program in the database for you - however if you have prepared
for previous or forthcoming PATT runs using the same user-id then these will
be available too.

<spacer type=vertical size=50> 
<br clear=left>
Move the cursor to the one you want, and enter the key value of 0.  Then click
on fetch.  Your program will be fetched from the database and displayed in
the OT ready for editing as normal.
<p>

Add a new Observation to your Science Program and complete it either by
copying the items you need from the Library, or by copying from one
of your existing Observations and changing the values as needed.  If you
need help with using the ORAC-OT you can access the help files by 
selecting "help" in the top right corner.  

<p>

When you have finished adding the new Observation to your Science Program,
click on the "database" item on the menu bar of the Science Program editing 
window :

<img src="odb_store.gif" align=left vspace=20>
<spacer type=vertical size=50> 
<br clear=left>
Select "Store to Telescope Site" to send the modified Science Program back
to the database.

<p>

To use the newly created Observation, go back to the main ORAC-OM screen:
<img src="om2.gif" align=left vspace=20>
<br clear=left>
Use <font color="lime"> fetch </font> to fetch the updated version of your
Program from the database to the ORAC-OM. 
<p>
The updated list of observations will appear in the Fetched Science Program 
list on the right.
<p>
Move the cursor until it is over the newly created Observation. Use the 
send for execution button to send it to the sequencer console
ready for execution .

<p>
The new Observation will be translated and will appear on the 
sequencer console, replacing the previous sequence.

<p>
Use the <font color="lime"> Run </font> button to start executing the
sequence for your next  Observation.
