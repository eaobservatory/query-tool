<H1> ORAC Observing Crib Sheet</H1>


This page gives a quick summary of the steps involved in running ORAC to
take data at the summit.  Read the step-by-step guides for a more detailed 
explanation of how to use it.


To start ORAC for observing, log into kiki and type the commands <br>
<font color="#00A5C6" > <b> orac_ufti_new </b>  <br>
<b> dramastart </b> <br>
<b>oracom </b> </font> <br>
to start up the ORAC Observing Manager (ORAC-OM).  
<p>
Go into the computer room and reboot the UFTI crate
<p>
A login in screen will appear. Enter your user-id and 
password into the appropriate boxes and click on OK.
<p>
A screen which tracks user information for UKIRT operations and for the 
datafile headers will the appear.   You <em><b> MUST </b> </em> 
fill out the entry for observer names and your PATT run number before the 
software will allow you to proceed. Click on OK.
<p>
The main Observing Manager screen will now startup.
<p>
Do not carry out any further steps until you see a message saying 
"connection info" on the x-term you started from.
<p>
On the left you will see a list of your science programs which you have
submitted to the database.  Move the highlight to the program you want to use,
then click on <font color="lime" ><b> Fetch </b> </font> to 
fetch the 
program from the database to the ORAC-OM.  
<p>
When your program has been fetched from the database a listing of all the
Observations you have created within it will appear in the "Fetched 
Science Program" area on the right.  The order in which the observations 
appear in the list is the same as they
were  in the Science Program when you created it using the OT.  

<p>
Move the highlight to the observation that you actually want to be executed 
and click on <font color="lime" > <b> send for execution  </b> </font>. Note 
that the action of this
button is only to start up the sequencer console and translate your 
Observaiton into executable form.  The system will not start to take 
data until you tell it
to do so via the sequencer console. 
<p>
It is helpful to organise the main Observing Manager window and the 
Observation Sequencer Console on the screen so that you can see both at the same time. (When you are ready to use a new Observation you will do so from the Observing Manager).
<p>
To start data taking press the  <font color="lime"> <b> Run </b> </font> button on the sequencer console.
<p>
To stop the sequence before it reaches the end use either the <font color="red"> <b> Stop asap 
</b></font> button or the <font color="red"> <b> stop at break </b>
</font> button on the sequencer console.
<p>
To start a sequence from any position, move the highlight to any item and 
then use the <font color="lime"> <b> Run From Highlight </b>
< /font > button.
<p>

To start the next Observation when the current one is finished : move the
highlight on the main ORAC-OM screen to the one you want to do, and click on
<font color="lime"> <b> send for execution </b></font>.  It will
be sent to the sequencer and replaces the old one.  Use <font color="lime"> <b> Run </b> </font> to start it.
<p>

<h3> To Exit from the system </h3>
<p>
Exit any console windows using File/Exit <br>
Exit the main oracom window by using the <font color="red"> Exit OM </font> 
buttom <br>
Exit the Quick Look using File/Exit <br>
