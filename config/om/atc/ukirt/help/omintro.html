<H1>Introduction to using ORAC for Observing</H1>

Follow the links or the index to find detailed help about each stage of the ORAC-OM. The
following is a quick over-view of how it is used, and there is a one 
page <A HREF="crib.html">"crib sheet" </A> here.

<p>
The ORAC observing system is designed to use Science Programs which have been
pre-prepared using the ORAC-OT, and submitted to the UKIRT database. These 
Science Programs contain all the information needed to obtain your data - 
such as
instrument configuration and co-ordinates.
<p>
Normally you will have created one Science Program for your PATT run, which 
contains many observations (one or more for each target). You 
can add definitions for new observations during observing by using the OT at 
the summit and submitting them to the database.
<p>
The ORAC-OM controls the login procedure and ensures that only you
(and your collegues) have access to your program and the co-ordinates
and observing plans therein. Once you have gone through the startup 
procedure, it will display a listing of programs you have stored in the 
database.
(You may have programs for more than one PATT run for example).  You chose the
one for the current observing run and then the OM will display 
all the Observations you have
defined for your program. When you select which observation you want to 
carry out, the selected observation is passed to the Observation
Sequencer for execution. The observation sequencer has a
console which allows you to stop and start the sequence, take
"movies" to check out the instrument configuration, etc.  When you have 
finished a given Observation you simply
choose the next one from the list on the ORAC-OM window.

<p>
To Start-up ORAC for observing, log into the observing control
workstation and type the command <font color="#00A5C6"><b> orac_om </b>
</font>
to start up the  ORAC Observing Manager (ORAC-OM).  Here is a link to the
step by step 
guide to<A HREF="omuse.html"> running
using the 
 ORAC Observing Manager  
</A> which can also be found from the help file index.
