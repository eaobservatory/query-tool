Introduction to using ORAC for Observing
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body TEXT="#000000" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#000080">

<H1> Using the ORAC-OM </H1>

<p>
To start ORAC for observing, log into the observing control
workstation and type the command <font color="#00A5C6"> <b> oracom </b> </font>
to start up the ORAC Observing Manager (ORAC-OM).  A login in screen which
looks like : 
<p>
<img src="login.gif" align=center width=400 height=400 hspace=50>




<p>
will appear. Enter your user-id and password into the appropriate boxes and
click on OK.
<p>
If you have mistakenly started the orac-om then use the <font color="#00A5C6"> <b> exit </b> </font> button to run it down. The <font color="#00A5C6"><b> help </b> </font> button displays this set of help files.

<p>
A screen which tracks user information for UKIRT operations and for the 
datafile headers will appear.  It looks like this :
<p>

<img src="bookkeep.gif" align=center width=400 height=400 hspace=50>

<p>
<p>
and requests the name of the people who
are actually observing and your PATT run number. It gives you the opportunity
to enter any comments  before starting observing (e.g. if you want to note
a comment about the weather).  You <em> MUST </em> 
fill out the entry for observer names and your PATT run number before
 proceeding. If you have forgotten your run number the UKIRT TSS can 
remind you. If you 
have entered information correctly once, then the software should use 
these values 
as defaults for future sessions.  When you have done with it click on
OK.  (The "clear" button will clear the entries if they are incorrect).

<p>
The main Observing Manager screen will now appear and it looks like this :
<p>
<p>
<img src="om2.gif" align=center width=500 height=350 hspace=50>


<p>
On the left you will see a list of your science programs which you have
submitted to the database. The area on the right will initially be empty.
If this is the first observing run for which 
you have created a Science Program using the ORAC-OT, then there will be 
only one program in the list. However you may wish to access old programs 
from previous runs.  Move the highlight to the program you want to use,
then click on <font color=lime><b> Fetch </b> </font> to 
fetch the 
program from the database.  You can move the highlight by dragging it with
the mouse, by clicking with the left mouse button on the item you want it
to move to, or by using the arrow keys.  The "return" key is equivalent to clicking on fetch.   The program "key" shown above the Program List is 
currently set to 0 for all Science Programs and all users, and is 
already entered for you.
(UKIRT may need to use more complex keys in the future).

<p>
If there is a network problem and your program does not appear quickly
use the yellow "stop this fetch" button to stop the attempt, and then seek help
from your TSS.
<p>
When your program has been fetched from the database a listing of all the
Observations you have created within it will appear in the "Fetched 
Science Program" area on the right.  
<p>
The order in which the observations appear in the list is the same as they
were  in the Science Program when you created it using the OT.  
<p>
If you are unsure which of your Observations does something, you can check 
the contents by expanding them on this display - just click on the "o-" 
symbol next to the Observation icon (like the + symbol in the OT). Or, move the higlight to the one you want to expand and press return.  The icons
in this display are the same as the ones in the OT.

<p>
If for some reason you have used the ORAC-OT to create an additional Science
Program, the "refresh Sp list" button will refresh the contents of the Science
Program list.  If you have created instead additional observations within your
Science Program then you can up-date the list on the right hand side by 
fetching the program again.


<p>
Move the highlight to the observation that you actually want to be executed 
and click on <font color="lime"> <b> send for execution </b></font>
<p>
<em> Note that the action of this
button is to perform all the tasks that are necessary to translate the 
Observation you defined into a form that can be "understood" by the instrument, sequencer and telescope, and the system will not start to take data until you tell it
to do so via the sequencer console. </em>


<p>
If this is your first observation of the night, the ORAC Observation Sequencer 
and its console will now start.  The sequencer drives all the actions needed
to take data and the console allows you to interact with it, for example
to start and stop the sequence execution, as well as providing feedback 
describing the status of your observation.
<p>
It is helpful to organise the main Observing Manager window and the Observation Sequencer Console on the screen so that you can see both at the same time. (When you are ready to use a new Observation you will do so from the Observing Manager).

<p>
The <A HREF="osuse.html"> next section</A> describes how to use the
ORAC Sequencer Console to control data taking.
 <p>

<h3> To exit from the system at the end of the night </h3>
<p>
Exit the console window using File/Exit <br>
Exit the main oracom window using the <font color="red"> 
Exit OM </font> button <br>
Exit the Quick Look using File/Exit <br>
Log out of Kiki.
