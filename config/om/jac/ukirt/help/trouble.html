<H1>Trouble Shooting , Known Bugs, etc. </H1>

<p>

If something goes wrong while you are taking data it is helpful to remember 
that the software consists of a number of independant modules which "talk to
each other" using various means.  If you read the error messages carefully
you can often work out which "module" the problem has happened in or if its
a communication problem.
<p>

Both the ORAC-OT and the ORAC-OM log messages to the xterm they are started 
up from.  If something does go wrong it is worth looking at these 
for an error message  - phrases containing the words "error", "failed to find",
"failed to connect" "lost" "Exception" "Null pointer" could all
be indicative of what the problem is and are worth putting into a fault
report.
<p>

<h2> Crashing Out and Re-starting </h2>

To <em> crash out </em> of the ORAC-OM and sequencer console, go back to
the xterm you started it up from.

<p>

Type "Control-C "

<p>

The ORAC windows will disappear and messages will appear on the xterm.

<p>
Type $DRAMA/drama.csh <br>
Then issue the command  "cleanup" <br>
It will report finding and killing some processes.

<p>

You are now ready to re-start the ORAC system.  If the problem
was actually in the instrument or telescope itself, then of course you should
fix these before re-starting ORAC.

<p>

When ORAC is crashed out of, the communication connection between it and
the UFTI crate is lost.  The only way to re-establish it is to reboot the
UFTI crate.  The startup procedure is therefore : <br> <font size="+1"><pre>
Type <b> oracom </b> to start bringing the system up <br>
Go into the computer room and type "reboot" on the UFTI terminal <br>
Watch the xterm until the "connection established" message appears <br>
After this you can login to ORAC by sending it your user-id and password <br>
</font></pre>
<p>

<h2> Database Connection Problems </h2>
<p>

If the ORAC-OM cannot "talk" to the database for some reason it will report
a problem with an error that begins "RMI".  eg :

<p>

This is because "RMI" is the name of the technology it is using to talk
to the database.  

<p>
Common causes of such a problem are that the database has stopped working
for some reason - msg looks like :

<p>
Or the observer has given the wrong password for their program  :
<p>

<h2> DHS and Quicklook Problems </h2>
<p>
If the quicklook display crashes then this can also cause problems with
the writing of files to disk because the DHS is responsible for both.
<p>
Make sure that for each observation the number is up-dating on the
Data taking and Filing Status display. If the DHS is no longer writing
files to disk it  will stop up-dating the "Last Saved" number.
<p>
It is a good idea to keep an eye on the status display showing the 
writing of data to disk, because currently the DHS can die "silently" i.e. 
without giving you an error message.  During 5 nights of commissioning this
happened two or three times so it is not a very common problem but it is worth
being aware of it. If the DHS does die, then the status display
stops updating. If the DHS does die then you should exit ORAC and run it
up again. 
<p>


<h3>  Sequencer Problems </h3>

The only problem seen with the sequencer during the commissioning nights
was that sometimes if you send a new observation for execution it does
not get loaded into the sequencer console, because there was something 
wrong with the sequence itself, and so it wont
load.  The most likely problem is that you have written an observation
using the OT that in the target information has either a space in the
name of or no name for either the target or guide star. This will cause the
sequence to fail because it can't send such things to the telescope. 



<h2> UFTI Problems </h2>

If there is a problem with UFTI then the TSS will use the UFTI Epics
control system to investigate, re-datum filter wheels or the shutter.
