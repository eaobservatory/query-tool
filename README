JAC Query Tool destructions.
--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

0. Ensure suitable versions of Java and Ant are available.
   On EAO systems with a recent Ant but bad Java, this might require:
setenv JAVA_HOME /local/java/jdk1.6
setenv PATH $JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
rehash

1. clone the repository ...
git clone git://github.com/eaobservatory/query-tool.git qt

2. change to the code directory ...
cd qt

3. the QT is no longer built using gmake, Ant ( ant.apache.org ) is
the preferred method of building.

ant
