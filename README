--------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this you already have the code.

For the sake of completeness here are the full instructions.

1a. if in Hilo ...
git clone /jac_sw/gitroot/qt.git qt

1b. if remote to the JAC ...
git clone ssh://ssh.jach.hawaii.edu/jac_sw/gitroot/qt.git qt

2. change to the code directory ...
cd qt

3. the QT is no longer built using gmake, Ant ( ant.apache.org ) is
the preferred method of building.

ant

Building from the master branch requires Java 1.5 or higher.
